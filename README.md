    Use the smtplib library to connect to the email server and send the emails.

    Use the email library to compose the email, including the recipient's email address, the subject, and the body of the email.

    Use the os library to access the report files that need to be sent.

    Use a for loop to iterate through the list of recipients and send the email and attachment.

    Use the schedule library to schedule the script to run daily at a specific time.

Automating file transfer

''' You work at a company that receives daily data files from external partners. These files need to be processed and analyzed, but first, they need to be transferred to the company's internal network.

The goal of this project is to automate the process of transferring the files from an external FTP server to the company's internal network.

Here are the steps you can take to automate this process:

    Use the ftplib library to connect to the external FTP server and list the files in the directory.

    Use the os library to check for the existence of a local directory where the files will be stored.

    Use a for loop to iterate through the files on the FTP server and download them to the local directory using the ftplib.retrbinary() method.

    Use the shutil library to move the files from the local directory to the internal network.

    Use the schedule library to schedule the script to run daily at a specific time.

    You can also set up a log file to keep track of the files that have been transferred and any errors that may have occurred during the transfer process. '''



Personal budgeting

''' The goal of this project is to create a personal budgeting app that allows users to track their income and expenses, set budget goals, and view their spending habits.

Here are the steps you can take to create this project:

    Use the sqlite3 library to create a database to store the user's budget data.

    Use the tkinter library to create a GUI for the app, including widgets such as labels, buttons, text boxes and tables.

    Use the pandas library to manipulate the data and generate charts and tables to visualize the user's budget data.
